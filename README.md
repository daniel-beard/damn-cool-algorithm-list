# damn-cool-algorithm-list
A list of algorithms I find super interesting and cool
Over time, I plan to add sample implementations for most (if not all) of these in whatever language I find myself needing them in, and add more as I come across them.

- Reservoir Sampling
- Bloom Filter
- dhash (Perceptual Image Hashing)
- DStarLite
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Pollard's rho algorithm (Integer factorization)
- BK trees
- [Voronoi Diagram](http://blog.alexbeutel.com/332/interactive-voronoi-diagrams-with-webgl/)
